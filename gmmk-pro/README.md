# Custom GMMK Pro rev1 ANSI keymap

Features only the slightest changes:

- Changed keymap.
- Turning on Caps Lock will light the left side of the board red.
- Holding down FN will light the right side of the board cyan.
- Holding down FN while turning the knob will perform horizontal scrolling (though it's slightly broken as it also triggers volume change too).
- Debounce type set to `sym_defer_g` for lesser chattering.

Compiled and tested on QMK version 0.21.6.
