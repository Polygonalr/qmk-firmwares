# Customized QMK firmware for Tiger80

My main keyborb. I love the Tiger80.

## Modifications

- Keymap changes to suit my tastes.
- FN+F13 to toggle layer 2. On layer 2,
  - SOCD cleaning for A and D keys for the normal keymap.
  - Null-cancelling for W, A, S and D keys for the nullcancel keymap.
  - Pause key toggle Rapidfire.
  - Hit Scroll Lock to toggle back to layer 0.
