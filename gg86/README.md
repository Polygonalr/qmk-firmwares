# Customized QMK firmware for Gopolar GG86

Modified to include BongoCat + WPM meter on the LED screen and shining the RGB on the caps lock key when caps lock is activated.

Updated to be compiled with QMK version 0.21.6. Take note it still throws `gg86: No LAYOUTs defined! Need at least one layout defined in info.json` warning. I no longer have a gg86 keyboard to test the code with, so use this code at your own risk!. If you are interested in the tested legacy code instead (compilable with QMK version 0.15.4), take a look at the [`legacy-gg86`](https://github.com/Polygonalr/qmk-firmwares/tree/legacy-gg86) tag of this repository.

For completeness sake, this folder also contains the VIA json file.
